## Reason

This **Export All Groups with Their Layers.jsx** file is the result of a deep reflection on the global export of grouped layers. Indeed, after conducting several searches on the net (YouTube, StackOverflow, GitHub and others) looking for a way to export the grouped layers with a single click while maintaining their respective names and positions from Photoshop but without satisfactory results. So, I was able to develop this solution allowing you to export all our layers after having grouped them all with a single click from Photoshop and to tell you the truth I am still proud of the result.ðŸ˜ƒ

## Usage

Place **Export All Groups with Their Layers.jsx** file in your folder **"C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop 2020\Presets\Scripts\"** and restart Photoshop. Scripts are now acsessible through Photoshop **"File > Scripts > Export All Groups with Their Layers"** menu items.

OR

Simply after downloading my **Export_Groups_From_Photoshop** folder from GitHub, you integrate your **Photoshop file in .psd format** into the folder, and then you open your Photoshop file. Once in the window, you activate the " script by going through Photoshop **"File > Scripts > Browse"** menu items.
